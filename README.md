# PDF-Vector-Barcode-Reader

Read vector barcodes from PDF files in .net.

It integrates several barcode SDKs which can read barcodes from PDF files.

The [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/) can directly read vector data while the other SDKs have to render PDF to images first.
